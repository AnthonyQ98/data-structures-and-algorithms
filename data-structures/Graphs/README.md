Vertex:
- Essentially a node of a graph. Has a name (we will call a key).. can also have additional information (such as the payload).

Edge:
- Also called an arc, another fundamental parrt of a graph. Connects two vertices to show relationship. Can be a one way or two way edge. If one way, we say it is a directed graph.

Weight:
- Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost t o go from one vertex to another.
- Weights could be used to represent distance (weight) between two cities (nodes) via a road (edge)

Path:
- Sequence of vertices connected by edges.
- Could be unweighted path (number of edges in path) or could be weighted path (sum of weights in path)

Cycle:
- Cycle in a directed graph refers to a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- No cycle graphs are called acyclic graphs.
- Directed graph with no cycles is called directed acyclic graph or DAG.
